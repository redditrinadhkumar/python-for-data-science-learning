# Python for Data Science – Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python Practice Repository!
This repo contains the coding notebooks I created while learning Python from scratch for Data Science. I started this journey 5 weeks ago and have been practicing consistently to build strong fundamentals.

🔥 What’s Included

The notebooks in this repo cover:

Topic	Skills Practiced
Python Basics	Variables, input/output, operators
Control Flow	if / elif / else, logical operations
Loops	for and while loops, nested loops
Functions	Parameters, return values, reusable code
Data Structures	Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
Problem Solving	Pattern questions, string manipulation, numeric programs
🎯 Purpose of this Repository

✔ Track my progress week by week
✔ Build confidence through hands-on practice
✔ Share learning material with other beginners
✔ Get feedback & improve my code

🏁 Next Steps in My Learning Plan

Over the next few weeks, I will start learning:

🔹 NumPy
🔹 Pandas
🔹 Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
🔹 Handling CSV files & datasets

I will continue to update this repository as I learn more.
